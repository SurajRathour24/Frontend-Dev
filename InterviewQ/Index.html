1. What is Implecent Return (Fetch API)
2. Always use await inside the try catch 
3. Fetch Is a promised based (So we are using Then and catch)
4. Type of NaN is a number : Failed operation so return number 
5. Dynamic Type : Means the data can be changed within the action 
6. Var is a functional scope and automatically add to window and also can redeclared
7. Arrow function always take value from parent (Example if method with arrow fnc created in obj)
8. Call bind, apply: used for make custom obj to be value of this in fnc 


Designer Patterns ::::::
1. We cancreate private variables/Function everything with IIFE , this prevant the using vaiables/function everything directly in console




Important Notes: 
1. Hmara saara js ka code ek function mai jata hai , jab hum usko run karte hai  (e.g:  var respects only functions) 


////////// Variables ////////////////////////

1. Var Hmesha window mai add hota hai , Means agr koi varibales window mai added hai toh mtlb voh var se created hai 
2. Var Only respect the function (Function scoped), can redeclear and reinitlize

/////////////////// Let & Const //////////////////////
1. Let and const not added in window 
2. They are blocked socped 
3. Let can be reassign , can't be redeclear and const can't be redeclear & reassign

/// TDZ = Temp[orarly dead zone

> JS ko pta hota hai ki in future koi variable hai ya nhiii , e.g agar 4th line pe a initialize or declear hai toh 1st line pe error aataa hai "can't access before initlize"
but agar 4th pe a naa bna hota toh eror "aana tha a is not define"

TDZ > Utna area jitne mai jS ko pta hai ki variable exist krta h but value ni de skta
