1. What is Implecent Return (Fetch API)
2. Always use await inside the try catch 
3. Fetch Is a promised based (So we are using Then and catch)
4. Type of NaN is a number : Failed operation so return number 
5. Dynamic Type : Means the data can be changed within the action 
6. Var is a functional scope and automatically add to window and also can redeclared
7. Arrow function always take value from parent (Example if method with arrow fnc created in obj)
8. Call bind, apply: used for make custom obj to be value of this in fnc
