We have 3 ways to include CSS in our html code 

1. Inline line css :- This CSS added in the html code within the line
2. Internal CSS :- Included in the head tag of the html page
3. External CSS: Most used way to use the CSS in html is external, which is used by the linking the css in the head tag of html.

=> Try not to use inline CSS , but sometime inline css automatically generated.

=> Use Internal CSS when your web page is small or you used only minor CSS design

=> Most of the case use External CSS only, Even try to create different css files for design , responsive , common style as well.
